just realized val dl not in test mode

new runs for that
bigger / deeper model better after moving to test mode
larger batch size also better

now let's try 2 tweaks:

1. swap to l1 loss on waveform  (as the MDX model does for vocal isolation, and it does very well)
2. remove the impossible frequencies.  e.g. if shifted up then down, top freqs are missing.  other direction we just lose fidelity, not all freqs.
removing them for shifting up is important because then the model tries to predict missing freqs, as that is a lot of the loss and easy to do, but doesn't actually improve quality

(output17)
First, doing 2., as it is likely more important for quality.


(output18)
trying 1., result after 10k steps is much worse sounding audio, lots of background noise

let's try CDPAM loss, a perceptual loss

CDPAM loss takes too much memory, 1/2 the sequence length to 32256 from 65024 samples

still too much memory, 1/2 batch size from 32 to 16

(output19)
really bad results, but checked and cdpam expects sample rate of 22050
Since the lower frequencies are where the problem is, let's try resampling it 

(output20)
terrible
somehow sounds even worse
super loud as well

new idea:
rather than estimate the final output
estimate the difference
this way the model doesn't have to copy the input over AND do the other stuff
maybe it will be better?

worse, definitely worse.

back to original method, reduce sequence length to 3/4 original, so 48640 instead of 65024, gives a little speedup and still processes a decent bit of audio
up the # of lowpass filters to 10 from 6, change to using a for loop (should have done that from the beginning)
back to batch size 32

not really any better.

Let's move from spectrogram models to trying out waveform models
