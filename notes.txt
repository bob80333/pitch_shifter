just realized val dl not in test mode

new runs for that
bigger / deeper model better after moving to test mode
larger batch size also better

now let's try 2 tweaks:

1. swap to l1 loss on waveform  (as the MDX model does for vocal isolation, and it does very well)
2. remove the impossible frequencies.  e.g. if shifted up then down, top freqs are missing.  other direction we just lose fidelity, not all freqs.
removing them for shifting up is important because then the model tries to predict missing freqs, as that is a lot of the loss and easy to do, but doesn't actually improve quality

First, doing 2., as it is likely more important for quality.
